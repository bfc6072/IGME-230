High Concepts

Quick, Difficult, and Tactical! You think you are connected with your friends? Guess again cause when you are chained together as simple primitive shapes and have to solve complicated fast pace puzzles on this endless runner we’ll really see how connected you are mentally and most likely emotionally.

Story
------
Spawned in as primitive shapes, specifically two squares. You’re probably questioning what’s going on? Don’t look over to your friend cause they’re in distrust too. The floor starts moving under you and obstacles appear. Don’t hit them or your existence as a shape will disappear. Both of you begin to dodge and then realize there’s a chain connected to your shapes. Don’t make a mistake or the string will become taught and you’ll restrict your movement. Shortly you see path’s that have specific shapes allocated to them. Don’t panic or you’ll miss the opportunity to smash a key and switch shapes in order to take that path. You inch farther and realize there are coins popping up. Don’t forget to catch them between your chain, because that’s the only way to get more points on this endless runner. Try to beat your score, try to see how far you get, and try to become the best.

Esthetics
------
<dl>
  <dt>Graphic Style</dt>
<dd>The graphic style is 2-Dimensional, minimalistic, and primitive. Just shapes and different colors. I would like to have the colors a  darker shade, then possibly illuminate certain pieces of the game.

  <dt>Sound</dt>
  <dd><h5>Music</h5></dd>
<dd>The music should keep the players on their feet as they flow through the different variations of the game. A nice simple 8 – Bit beat that is somewhat fast pace should fit the game’s Esthetics as a simple 2D endless runner.

  <li> Coin collection sound, whenever the players collect a coin between their chain an 8 – bit coin collection sound should go off. (https://freesound.org/people/ProjectsU012/sounds/341695/) </li>
  <li> Player Switching shapes, whenever the player swaps between shapes a sound should play. Not completely sure what I want to play but here are a few ideas.

Game Play
------
<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Movement/Chains</dt>
<dd>Players are able to move in range of the length of the chain that is attached to them. This chains length will vary depending on where they are in the game. This chain is also used to collect coins.</dd>

<dt>Morph Shapes</dt>
	<dd>Players can morph in-between shapes in order to fit through certain paths.</dd>

<dt>Paths</dt>
<dd>There are certain paths that correspond to a certain shape. If the player doesn’t transform to that shape in time or doesn’t have the ability to transform to that shape, then they aren’t able to take those paths.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Control</h3>

* Keyboard
  * Player 1 : WASD & Left Ctrl
  * Player 2: Arrow Keys & Right Ctrl
* Xbox Controllers
  * Movement: Left Axis or Arrows
  * Morph: A or Right Trigger
* Mobile
  * Virtual sticks
  * Accelerometer & Touch Screen

<h3>Teaching</h3>
  The player is taught how to play by being thrown into the game and slowly having different mechanics of the game appear.
<ol>
<li>Movement is taught with adding simple obstacles with wide openings. This all should be obvious to the player since it’s natural to try and move players between obstacles.</li>
<li>Coin Collection is taught with adding a coin and then showing a picture of the chain intersecting with the coin to collect it</li>
<li>Pathing and Morphing will be introduced similarly to Coin collections where a picture will be shown directing the players</li>
</ol>
<h3>Learning</h3>
	After learning the basics of the game then the player should be fine. There really is no way to actually beat the game since it’s an endless runner. The best way to proceed far in the game is…
* Quick thinking: The player should be able to make decisions on a fly. If they hesitate in their decisions or don’t choose quick enough they might end up losing the game.
* Communication between players: Communication between players is key especially when there seems to be no chemistry. Since both players are connected their decisions might have an effect on each other.
* Sense of space: There are points in the game where the player is given a very narrow path. They need to be able to determine the size of their shape and the space of the path.

I was planning on making this game in Unity, I’m not sure if we’re supposed to use a specified engine or development tool for this game.
